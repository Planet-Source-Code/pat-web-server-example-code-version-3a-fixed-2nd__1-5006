## Web Server example Code version \.3a FIXED \(2nd\)


</div>

### Description

This is an example project on how to create a web server. I looked on this site and haven't seen any, so i decided to make one. I commented everythign as much as i could. Let me know what you think about it :) This code has been updated. I removed the pause of .4 seconds and moved the code to sckWS_SendComplete. I want to thank Ron for letting me know that it would slow it down. :) Please post any suggestions/improvments or just your thoughts on it. :)

'v .2a fixed: some loading problems

'v .3a fixed: fixed the $ip linking problem, everything works now. :)

' also fixed: i made the project compatible with vb5 by removing the replace

' function.

' Creating a link to another page

' To link to another page, link to 'http://$ip/page_name.html'

'The webserver will replace $ip with your ip. The webserver also

'supports files in other directories in the html dir. You could link

'to test.html in the directory 'links' by linking to:

' http://$ip/links/test.html

'

'     PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS!
